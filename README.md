# DUMME
This is my entry into Robotics, I started this project on a rainy day in febuary my senior year of high school. I was building a circuit using my Arduino and I was wondering if
it was possible to build a robot using the Arduino. So I began doing the research when I stumbled upon the Arduino Braccio which was a kit robotic arm for $500 USD. I thought woah
thats way too expensive I'll build my own robot for cheaper! Spoiler it was not cheaper, I did some more research into open source robotics and stumbled upon the Source Robotics
Parol6 3D Printed Robot. I decided to build and expand on the capabilities of the Robot by using it for PCB assembly, as well as
